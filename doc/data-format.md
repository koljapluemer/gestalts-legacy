A note is any YAML. Conventions, all optional:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | global uuid, normally also the file name |
| `title` | one line |
| `main` | the content, usually multi-line |
| `extra` | more Markdown, shown below `main`; references in it count as in `main` |
| `tasks` | a note about the note, e.g. what's left to do with it |
| `aliases` | other names, list of strings |
| `tags` | contexts the note is (not) used in; letters, digits, dashes |
| `relationships` | list of `<uuid>` or `{to: <uuid>, label: <label>}`; label `inline` for each `[[uuid]]` in `main`, `extra` or a card, kept in step by the app |
| `blobs` | list of `<file>` or `{file: <file>, label: <label>}`; images and videos attached to the note are labelled `image` / `video`; every `![[file]]` embedded in the text is listed |
| `upstream` | where a copied note came from, see [Published decks](#published-decks) |
| `canvas`, `template`, `cards` | the note's own canvas, template and flashcards ([gestalts.md](gestalts.md#folded-parts)) |
| `folded` | on a retired note whose content moved into another note: `{into, hash}` ([gestalts.md](gestalts.md#folded-parts)) |

How the core copes with missing or broken pieces:
- A note without an `id` is addressed by its key, the file name without `.yml`.
- A file name that isn't a uuid is fine.
- Text that doesn't parse is kept as it is and reported as an error, so the universal editor can still fix it.
- An empty file counts as an empty map.

## Published decks

A deck shipped read-only (like the Demo's `public/gestalt-data`) follows a few more rules, so that copies in user space can follow it:
- **Blobs are content-addressed**: `<first 16 hex digits of sha256>.<ext>`. A replaced image gets a new name, which changes the note that uses it.
- **Notes are never deleted, they're retired**: tag them `retired`. Perspectives skip retired notes, and copies pick the tag up like any other change.
- **Note ids are the file names**, since relationships are resolved to keys in the deck.
- Deck notes have no `upstream` field. User-space copies get one, appended as the last lines:

  ```yaml
  upstream:
    source: demo        # the user-space folder's name
    hash: <sha256 of the deck note's text as copied>
  ```

  A copy is untouched while the text before the trailer still has that hash.

To publish after editing notes or overwriting blob files, run `mise run publish-data <folder>` and commit the result. It:
1. renames blobs to their content hash and rewrites the notes that use them
2. deletes blobs no note uses
3. writes `index.json`
4. lints

Running it again changes nothing.

Keys and blob names must not contain `/`, `\` or control characters, and must not start with `.`.
