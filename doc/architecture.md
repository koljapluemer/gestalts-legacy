# Architecture

```
crates/merge          symmetric, rule-based 3-way merge of YAML values; knows nothing of notes
crates/core           notes, gestalts, queries, sync, tombstones, blob collection; the Storage port. No IO.
crates/fs             Storage adapter: a folder on disk
crates/wasm           the core in the browser + adapters: OPFS, static decks, connector (HTTP)
crates/plugin-host    plugin manifests (plugin.yml, schema 2) and the gestalts of core + plugins
crates/connector      gestalts-connector: desktop app serving a folder on localhost, and the worker host
gestalts/             the core's gestalt definitions (data, embedded into the core)
packages/sdk          @gestalts/sdk: the perspective port (Repo interface, hooks, host capabilities, slots)
packages/kit          @gestalts/kit: the public components, on the sdk only
packages/learning     @gestalts/learning: FSRS by facet, practice sessions, learnable cards
packages/client       the host's core in the browser: the wasm-backed Repo, opening, syncing
packages/ui           the host: panes from pane notes, plugin installs, the capability frame, connector settings
plugins/<id>/         domain bundles: plugin.yml, their gestalts, deck, ui/ and worker/
apps/gestalter        a distribution: the host with every plugin, panes as tabs
apps/demo             a distribution: the host with greek-alphabet, its one pane alone
```

How this came about, and what's left for after the split into repos: [foundations.md](foundations.md).

## Core (Rust, native and wasm)

- `Storage` (port): list/read/write/delete notes by key, list/read/write blobs by name. `?Send` so browser adapters fit.
- Adapters: `FsStorage` (disk, atomic writes), `Opfs`, `Static` (read-only, a published data folder with `index.json`), `Connector` (HTTP), `Layered` (any number of read-only decks + a writable top, copy-on-write), `Memory`.
- `Repo`: loads every note into an index (parsed YAML, gestalts, lints) and answers `Query {gestalt, gestaltsNone, tagsAll, tagsNone, keys, where}`, skipping tombstones. Its gestalts are the core's plus those of the app's plugins, loaded at runtime.
- `merge_note` / `sync`: see [connector.md](connector.md#sync); deletes are tombstones ([gestalts.md](gestalts.md#deleting)).
- `upstream`: copy-on-write from published decks into the user's storage, see below.
- `blobs`: which blobs notes use, and collecting the rest ([connector.md](connector.md#sync)).

The browser never parses YAML itself: `packages/client` calls the wasm core, which also lints drafts (`repo.inspect`) for the editor.

## Data flow in the apps

| app | storage | with connector |
|---|---|---|
| Gestalter | OPFS `gestalter/`, over the decks of its installed plugins (greek-alphabet) | OPFS syncs with the folder |
| Demo | OPFS `demo/` over the greek-alphabet deck; a word is copied into OPFS when first rated | only the OPFS layer syncs with the folder |

Both work without the connector. Connecting is remembered per browser.

### Copy-on-write from a deck

A learner's data must stand on its own: a folder synced from the Demo holds the rated words, not just review states pointing at words that live elsewhere. So user space is **closed under references**:
- Writing a note through `Layered` copies every deck note it references (`relationships`), from the deck that has it, with that note's blobs and, in turn, its references. Rating a word writes an `fsrs-state` note, which copies the word.
- `pull_upstream` runs on open and after each sync. It copies whatever is still missing (e.g. references that arrived by sync) and brings copies up to date.

Each copy is the deck text plus an `upstream` trailer naming the deck (its plugin's id; see [data-format.md](data-format.md)). A deck may list earlier ids as `aliases`: copies made under one follow it too, as the Demo's copies (`source: demo`) follow the greek-alphabet plugin's deck. When a deck changes:
- an untouched copy is replaced with the new upstream text
- an edited copy is left alone and reported as diverged
- words nobody rated simply stay upstream, so they update for free

The repo's `upstreamReport()` says what the last check did; the Demo logs it to the console. A tombstone in user space hides the deck note under it, and is never copied over.

## Packages and plugins

`oxlint.config.ts` enforces who may import whom (eslint-plugin-boundaries):

- `@gestalts/sdk` imports nothing of ours. It's the perspective port: the `Repo` interface (notes cross it parsed;
  only the host's core parses YAML), the hooks (`useQuery`, `useData`, `useNote`, `useBlobUrl`, `useSettings`),
  `definePerspective`, `definePane`, host capabilities (`useHost`), `Slot`, the field and note helpers (`fold`,
  `inline`, conflicts), and natives the host provides (ids, hashes, BibTeX). No wasm, so it can later run in a
  sandboxed frame.
- `@gestalts/kit` imports only the sdk, in layers, each from below: `primitives/` (CodeMirror, `Markdown`,
  `MarkdownEditor`), `components/` (`NoteLine`, `GestaltBadges`, `YamlEditor`, `Modal`), `widgets/` (`NoteView`,
  `NoteTextEditor`, `EditableNote`, `NoteParts`, `Relationships`, `MediaGallery`, `NotePicker`, `SourcePicker`,
  `Conflicts`, the note search), `views/` (`SearchSidebar`, `UniversalEditor`, `NewNote`, `SearchLayout`,
  `useUrlList`). Tailwind + daisyUI + lucide are the real primitives.
- `@gestalts/learning` imports only the sdk.
- A plugin's UI (`plugins/<id>/ui/src`) imports only the sdk, the kit and learning: never another plugin, the client
  or the host. `mise run check-plugin-standalone <id>` builds one outside the workspace against the packed public
  packages, as in a repo of its own.
- `@gestalts/client` (the core in the browser) builds on the sdk; the host (`packages/ui`) on client, sdk and kit.
- Apps load plugins only through `virtual:gestalts-plugins`.

### Plugins

A plugin is a domain bundle in `plugins/<id>/` with a `plugin.yml` (schema 2):

```yaml
schema: 2
id: greek-alphabet
version: 1.0.0
host_api: 1
gestalts: [pronunciation-card@1]           # owned here, defined in gestalts/<name>/v<N>.yml
uses: [fsrs-state@1, practice-session@1]   # owned elsewhere: a data dependency
deck: { path: deck, aliases: [demo] }      # starter data, published-deck format
panes:
  - { id: practice, title: Greek alphabet, entry: ui/src/index.ts#PracticePane }
slots:                                     # e.g. canvas: { slot: note-view, gestalt: canvas@2, entry: … }
access:
  read: { gestalts: [pronunciation-card@1, fsrs-state@1, practice-session@1] }   # or `all`
  write: { gestalts: [fsrs-state@1, practice-session@1] }
worker: …                                  # optional, see connector.md
```

- **Gestalts** have exactly one owner: the core, or one plugin. Those that more than one plugin uses are the core's;
  a plugin owns only its own domain (`pronunciation-card@1`, `quote@1`, `typst-document@1`). The apps and the
  connector load every plugin's gestalts, so their lints and merge rules apply, even for a plugin that's uninstalled.
- **Built-in plugins**: explorer (Explorer, New note), canvas (Canvas; the `note-view` slot of `canvas@2`), typst
  (Canvas2Typ, and the `typst@1` worker), sources, learn, quotes, greek-alphabet (with the Demo's deck).
- **Distributions**: an app is the host plus `distribution.yml` (`plugins`, `default_panes`, `install_ui`). A Vite
  plugin (`scripts/vite-gestalts-plugins.ts`) turns it into `virtual:gestalts-plugins`: each plugin's manifest, its
  gestalts, its deck (served under `decks/<id>/`) and loaders for its UI modules. The app builds with any list.
- **Installs** are `plugin-install@1` notes (`stableId("plugin", id)`), seeded for the distribution's plugins once
  a new folder has synced, so they sync like notes. The Gestalter's plugin menu enables, disables, uninstalls and
  reinstalls them, showing what each may read and write. Uninstalling unmounts the deck (after a reload); the
  user's copies stay unless "also delete my copies" asks to delete the notes copied from its deck.

### Panes and the host

- **Panes are notes** (`pane@1`): the Gestalter's tabs. Opening one writes a note, closing it deletes it, dragging
  sets its `position`. `?pane=<note key>` selects one. A folder without pane notes gets the distribution's
  `default_panes`, under stable keys, so devices seeding at once write the same notes. A pane's own settings are
  its note's `params`.
- **The capability frame** (`host/PaneFrame.tsx`) runs each pane with the host's capabilities (`useHost()`):
  `openNote` and `createNote` (the host's editor or new-note form over the pane, kept in the URL as
  `?overlay=note:<key>` or `new`, so Back closes it), `pickNote`, `navigate`, `setTitle`, and `slot`, the views
  installed plugins registered (`<Slot name gestalt noteKey/>`). A perspective hides what the host doesn't offer.
- **Access**: the pane's repo is scoped to its plugin's `access`. It reads only notes in `read`, and writes only
  notes that are in `write` before and after; a write scoped by gestalt must give a note that has the gestalt, so
  one breaking its rules is refused. Slot views get their own plugin's scope.
- `debug/` (`@gestalts/ui/debug`): `ErrorBoundary` (around each pane), `DebugLogButton`. See [debugging.md](debugging.md).

## Canvas and Typst

A canvas is the `canvas` key of its host note (`canvas@2`); its linked notes are `on-canvas` relationships of the
host, so they travel with it. An old `canvas@1` note (`canvas-of` the host) is shown until the first change folds it
into the host and retires it ([gestalts.md](gestalts.md#folded-parts)). While it's open, the page's reducer is the
only truth (`plugins/canvas/ui/src/model.ts`); `CanvasSaver` writes whole snapshots, debounced, one at a time, held
while dragging. If the stored nodes change to something this page didn't write (a sync, the YAML editor), it stops
writing and offers to reload; changes to the host's other keys don't count. A host whose YAML doesn't parse makes
the canvas read-only.

The note editor shows a note's cards and template below its YAML (kit `widgets/NoteParts.tsx`), folding attached ones in
on the first save the same way. Since a note can now be written by these and by the YAML editor at once, the YAML
editor saves a draft as a 3-way merge against the text it started from (`repo.merge3`, the merge a sync does). If
both changed the same value, it asks before overwriting.

The Typst editor compiles through the connector's `typst@1` service (`plugins/typst`, which also has the Canvas2Typ pane; it shows the canvas through the `note-view` slot, so notes are added to a canvas in the Canvas pane), sending the source, the
document's `assets` (path → blob, fetched by the worker) and a bibliography of the sources it cites
(`/sources.bib`). Without the service the document is still editable and shows its last built PDF. Build PDF stores
the PDF as a content-addressed blob labelled `pdf`; saving adds a `cites` relationship to each source cited.

## Note view

The editor (kit `UniversalEditor`) shows a note in one of three modes, remembered per note for the browser session:
- **Read** (kit `widgets/NoteView.tsx`): its images and videos (blobs labelled `image`/`video`, or unlabelled ones that
  are by extension) in a gallery, then `tasks`, `main`, `extra` and its cards rendered, then its other blobs as links.
- **Text** (kit `widgets/NoteTextEditor.tsx`): title, `main` and `extra` as Markdown, with a preview beside them (below
  when narrow). `[[` completes a note from the search and inserts its id. Mod-click on a reference opens it, and on
  touch screens a button above the reference under the cursor does. Saves on blur and Mod-s, field by field against
  the note as it is by then. If the note changed one of the same fields meanwhile, it asks.
- **YAML**: the raw note, as before.

Images and videos are attached from the toolbar (on touch screens also from the camera), or by pasting or dropping
them into the text. They're written at once, as content-addressed blobs. Images are downscaled to 1920 px and
re-encoded as WebP (lossless from PNG and BMP; GIF and SVG kept as they are). Videos up to 250 MB are stored as they
are. Removing one takes it off `blobs`; the blob itself stays.

Every save of the text, of the YAML or of the cards keeps the note's `inline` relationships in step with the
`[[references]]` in `main`, `extra` and its cards, and lists each `![[embed]]` in `blobs` (`syncInline`,
`packages/sdk/src/inline.ts`). The copy-on-write closure and backlinks then follow prose links like any other
relationship. A YAML save is written as typed unless that changes something.

`Relationships` lists a note's own relationships (`→`), its inline references (`⇢`) and its backlinks (`←`, `⇠`).
The backlinks come from one index per repo version, built from every note's relationships and from the references
in their text, so notes edited elsewhere count too. Explicit rows can be detached and relabelled, and the adder
relates a picked note in either direction. Each change is written at once, to whichever note holds the relationship.
Inline rows are edited in the text.

## Learn

The Learn pane (`plugins/learn`) reviews every flashcard by FSRS, as dsl's Learn tab did. The cards come from
`learnableCards` (`@gestalts/learning`): each card in a note's `cards`, each `flashcard@1` that is
`card-of` a note without `cards` yet, and each `flashcard@1` of its own. A card of a note is reviewed as the facet
`<card id>` of that note, so its state stays put when the card is folded in; a flashcard of its own as the whole note.
`pickNext` shows a random due card, else a random new one, never the one just rated unless it's the only one; the
card shown stays until it's rated, even if a sync changes the picks. The front, then Reveal (Space), then front and
back with Again, Hard, Good, Easy (1–4); the counts are due · new · all. Reviews go through `saveReview` and the
`learn` practice session. A rating shows the next card at once: `useLocalReviews` lays the new state over the
query's until the query has it, and the save runs in the background (it may wait behind a sync); if it fails, an
alert says so. The Greek alphabet works the same way. Deleting a card deletes its `fsrs-state` too (`dies_with_target`).

## Search sidebar

Search runs client side over every note:
- Every query word must match a word of the note, or a prefix of one. Case and accents are ignored.
- Rarer words weigh more, and exact words beat prefixes.
- A match in `title`, `aliases` or `main` beats a match elsewhere.
- Filters: `#tag` or `tag:x`, `gestalt:name@1`, `-word`.
- An empty query lists every note by label. The storage port has no modification times, so there's no "recent" list.

Keys: `/` focuses the search. Use ↑/↓ and Enter to open a result, and Esc to leave the field.
