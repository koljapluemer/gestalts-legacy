/**
 * One perspective's practice, as `practice-session@1` notes. Pure: times come in as milliseconds, and writes go out
 * through `takeWrites` (see `usePracticeSession`).
 *
 * - Active time: a gap between two activities counts, up to `IDLE_MS`. A gap that began with the page hidden
 *   counts nothing.
 * - A session starts at its first trial, so opening a perspective writes nothing. Its `started` is the first
 *   activity before that trial, and its active time includes the time spent before it.
 * - After a gap of more than `SESSION_GAP_MS` the session is over, and the next trial starts a new note.
 * - `ended` is the last activity, kept current, so a closed tab still leaves a finished session.
